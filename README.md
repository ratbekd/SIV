# SIV
Synthetic Instrumenat Variable Method
This paper introduces a novel Synthetic Instrumental Variable (SIV) method that constructs valid instruments using only existing data, addressing key challenges in traditional instrumental variable approaches. We demonstrate that any valid instrument can be represented as a linear combination of coplanar vectors spanned by the outcome and endogenous variables in a reduced form. Based on these coplanar vectors, we develop a "dual tendency" (DT) condition that provides a moment-based criterion for identifying valid SIVs, bridging the gap between unobservable orthogonality conditions and observable data characteristics. The SIV method is robust to address potential heteroscedasticity. Our method can also determine the true sign of $cov(\bf x,u)$, often assumed a priori in empirical work.  Using simulated data and empirical applications, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The SIV method offers advantages over traditional IV approaches by mitigating issues of weak or invalid instruments and reducing reliance on scarce external instruments. This approach has broad implications for improving causal inference in various fields, such as economics, epidemiology, and policy evaluation.
